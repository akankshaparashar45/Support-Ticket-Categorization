# Support-Ticket-Categorization
Natural Language Processing
# Objective

The goal of this project is to develop an **AI-powered customer support automation system** that can:

- **Categorize** incoming support tickets into relevant issue types.
- **Generate meaningful tags** for easier filtering and searchability.
- **Assign ticket priority and expected resolution time (ETA)** based on the context.
- **Draft a professional first-response message** for each ticket.

This system helps businesses **automatically triage and respond** to support queries, improving customer experience and support efficiency.

# Installation
**Install dependencies locally**
  
  ```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
 
Note: These libraries were installed and tested using Python 3.8.5.
